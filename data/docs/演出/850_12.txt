Mark自己介绍他最近发行的solo专辑，《Golden Ratio》： 
Became interested in Just Intonation in late 2006, by way of Terry Riley, La Monte Young, Harry Partch and others. First hurdle was what to use as an instrument. I settled on an electric guitar laid flat on a table, hands free. The tools I used were an ebow, a multi-track recorder, a calculator, a precision tuner, and a copy of the book “Just Intonation Primer.”
I multi-tracked long static drones that were calculated to produce just intervals, then created the illusion of musical movement by mixing the individual tracks in a random manner.
Moving on from the guitar I built three electric monochords, each with a moveable bridge, pickup and cradle for ebow. Then I introduced wind instruments, voice drones, and defretted guitars.
I began having serious doubts about the musical value of these strictly drone experiments. Began research for an instrument that would allow for precise tuning as well as full musical playability.
Acquired a Farfisa Compact Organ. By accident I discovered that the 12 individual tone generators for each note had screws providing for precision tuning. Felt like I won the lottery.
This album is a collection of my best work from this time period, 2007-2008.
