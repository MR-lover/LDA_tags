Blackwater @DDC：
Blackwater is an international band based in Beijing, China, playing Irish music since 2009. It consists of the singer Desmond McGarry (Canada), Zoe Wang (China) on the accordion, Kyle Daley (USA) on whistle, vocals and bodhran, and Nico Torrese (France) on the guitar.
 Their music draws from the rich traditional Irish repertoire (The Limerick Rake, The Foggy Dew, Wild Rover, I’ll Tell Me Ma, Spancill Hill, John Ryan’s Polka…. and much more). From beautiful ballads to frenzied jigs and reels, Blackwater is probably the most authentic Irish music band one can listen to in Beijing. They ‘ve played in countless bars and pubs around Beijing, and also have performed on much bigger stages like the National Library of China or the Tianjin Concert Hall. They are regularly invited to music festivals around China (Dong Folk Festival, Music on Water at Zhujiajiao, Shanghai, World Music festival of Hohot Inner Mongolia). The Irish community of Beijing and the Irish Embassy also trust Blackwater to bring its authentic touch to many public and private events. But their most special concert is definitely the one they’ve played for the President or the Republic of Ireland in june 2010.
Blackwater has recorded a CD named ‘Blackwater’ for Tree Music Label in 2010.
