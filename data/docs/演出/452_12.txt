Well-known as the China’s best jazz vocalist, singer-songwriter, Jess Meider hails from the US and has been a performing resident of Beijing for nearly two decades. 
Guitarist and bassist, Gao Fang is a native Beijinger, accomplished composer, producer and a graduate of Beijing’s first and only modern music school, CMA.
Combine Jess’s Berklee-bred high-quality vocals and songwriting with Gao Fang’s eclectic and intricate electronic music, and you get Chinatown. To see them live on stage is one of the most listenable, danceable and lyrically rich electronic experiences of your life.
We asked them how they classify their music, and they replied, “shufu (comfortable).” 
The performance at DDC will include first a LIVE DJ set with Gao Fang and a set of live electronica with Jess and Gao Fang.
Jess Meider来自美国，毕业于美国伯克利音乐学院，是位优秀知名的爵士歌手、创作者，已在北京演出近二十载。
吉他手/bass手高放来自北京，毕业于现代音乐学院(CMA)，集器乐演奏、作曲、制作为一身。
Chinatown融合了Jess Meider专业优美的嗓音和高放缜密复杂的电声编曲，她的现场悦耳动听，听众不由自主随之摇摆。
如果非要问如果形容她的音乐，她会说“舒服的”。
