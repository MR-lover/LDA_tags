《STRAW DOGS - About Gangster Brother and His......》
The film is divided into three parts:

The second part: Brothers and fellow-villager. When Li Zhang heard that Hui Wang was released from jail, he took the film director to Jie Xiu City to visit him. Although his gangster brother was surprised by the film director, he still helped Li with finishing the film shooting.
Chinese New Year was approaching. To take home what they had earned in the past one year, the villagers began to collect their salary, which their bosses owed them. However, not everybody could take their money back. Some people had to steal to get some money for celebrating the New Year.
The third part: A countryside hymn (and attachment). When he got his countryside home, Li Zhang met with his relatives. His face, in front of the camera, became a sign that he was more successful than the other fellow-villagers, who worked in the city.  
When Li Zhang and the film director returned the city, they began to have more conflicts…
