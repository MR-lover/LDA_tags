10466	澳大利亚音乐人•MAPLE专场	MAPLE, or 阿枫, is a fearless storyteller from Brisbane, Australia, currently endeavouring to master the Chinese language and pursue a career in China. Before graduating from university in 2014, Maple recorded 5 original songs in Chinese (Mandarin), lyrics co-written with Tom Sun (孙新雨) and produced by Jared Adlam (NZ). It only takes one listen through this gorgeous bunch of songs to know he is headed some place different.
"Maple … an ancient mind in a techno-riddled world."
Maple's debut EP, The Beginning, is a fascinating listen, combining both English and Chinese to express an idea of what is to come. His voice smooth like Jeff Buckley after a fine whiskey, as charming as his melodies. This is an artist to watch in the future, for his story is yet unfinished…
